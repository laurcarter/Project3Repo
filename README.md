## Overview:
This Healthcare Assistant is powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
(RAG) pipeline. The application will assist users (patients and medical professionals) by: 
• Providing precise, evidence-based answers to medical queries,
• Offering a voice-based interface using speech-to-text capabilities,
• The assistant will utilize LangChain for pipeline orchestration, 
• Hugging Face and OpenAI models for NLP,tasks, and recursive retrievers for efficient information retrieval. 

## Problem Statment:

Healthcare professionals and patients often struggle with information overload. This project seeks to
address:
• Difficulty in retrieving specific medical information quickly.
• The need for accurate, trustworthy answers to health-related questions.

## Objectives:

1. Build a healthcare assistant using RAG to retrieve and generate accurate responses.
2. Incorporate speech-to-text capabilities for improved accessibility.
3. Ensure responses are contextually relevant and supported by medical data.
   
## Links to data:
MedQuAD Dataset: A medical question-answering dataset with FAQs from Kaggle.

## Core Frameworks:
• LangChain: For pipeline orchestration. 
• Hugging Face: For transformer-based language models. 
• OpenAI GPT Models: For generative response generation. 
• Groq LLM (if available): High-performance NLP tasks. 

## Key Features:
1. Natural Language Querying: Users can input text-based or voice-based queries.
2. Evidence-based Responses: Retrieve relevant information from the MedQuAD dataset and
other medical sources.
3. Voice Interaction: Integrate speech-to-text using Whisper for seamless voice input.
   
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Fetch and preprocess the MedQuAD dataset. 
   - Use semantic chunking to divide data into retrievable segments.
